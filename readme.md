## Weekly Recap  

This week, I learned about Node.js web servers, async/await, and Promises.  

#### Node.js Web Servers  
- Node.js web servers handle HTTP requests dynamically.  
- The http module allows me to create custom web servers.
- The basic setup includes:  
  - Importing http
  - Use http.createServer()
  - Listen on a port

#### Async / Await  
- Async functions return Promises, making asynchronous code more readable.
- Await pauses the execution until a Promise is complete.
- Errors are managed with try...catch blocks.

#### Promises  
- A Promise is an asynchronous operationâ€™s result.
- then() handles success, catch() handles errors, () runs always.
